This is a small and silly way to generate level 0 characters using a custom rule set for ad&d 2e. 

COPY OVER AS IT, THE BURNER DOES ALL STAT?HP ADJUST FOR YOU!!!

Rule changes:

Custom save scores:
The save scores are not the same used in the player's handbook. They are reliant on your stats.

Custom stats:
This generator uses two custom stats, Luck and Appearance. Luck is self-explanatory, a quick way to illustrate how (un)lucky a character is. Appearance is how physically attractive a character is. 

Assumed custom rules:
These are rules used by me for level-0 grinder games, and as such what the burner is built around as well.

Peasants & Weapon proficiencies:
Level 0's do not have weapon proficiencies. They can use any weapon that fits into their size category without penalty. 

Peasants & Scrolls:
Peasants have the possible chance of using scrolls of level 1 or lower. To do this, they must have the spellcraft proficiency and make a luck check. If they succeed, they cast the spell as if they were a level 1 caster. If they fail, roll a d20.

On a 1-10, nothing happens.
On an 11-13, the scroll immolates. Dealing 1d6 damage to the caster
on a 14-16, the spell casts targeted at the caster.
on a 15-19, The spell is lost as the scroll crumbles to dust.
On a 20, they cast reckless dweomer

Peasants & Wonderous items:

A level 0 adventurer can use wonderous items not class-restricted.

-Reading the results-

You have a small chance of getting a free slot. These slots can be filled with any proficiency from the player's handbook.

Weapon(Damage Small-Medium/Damage large)
